<p>   The  element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
        It has a start tag  and an end tag 
        Here is a quote from WWF's website:

        For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
    </p> 
    Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
    You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.

    Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.
    In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.
HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
HTML Link Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and redThe title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

Vertical Table Headers
To use the first column as table headers, define the first cell in each row as a <th> element:






HTML <q> for Short Quotations
    The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
    
    Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
    
    Example
    <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>"color:blue;"
